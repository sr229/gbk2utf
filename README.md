# gbk2utf8

This utility is designed to convert any file encoded with GBK to standard UTF-8. This is based on another [package](https://github.com/best-flutter/gbk2utf8) meant for Flutter but has been redone to be usable for non-Flutter applications.

## Usage

TBD - This library is not that properly tested.
